How to use the tool
--------------------

To start the tool, first click “run”. A map of the Navajo Nation should pop up with some of it being bright colors. This is the default scoring. A user can adjust the weights by moving the sliders on the right. Ensure the weights all add to one. Then click “Update Suitability Map”. The map should regenerate with the colors slightly adjusted.

If you want to determine the score of a particular location, click the location on the map and its associated score will pop up below the “Update Suitability Map” button.

How to interpret the tool
---------------------------

There is a histogram above the sliders. This shows the distribution of the scores for all of the feasible areas. Click on a specific location. Find where the associated score is on the histogram. If most of the distribution is to the left of the score, then that location is more preferable.

If the region is black, it was deemed infeasible. Follow the legend to determine the general trend of suitability such as what color demonstrates higher suitability. 

Zoom in to your specific region of interest and determine what sites have higher suitability.

Data
------------

The current data includes the following: solar, slope, ecological sensitivity, distance to waterways, distance to roads, distance to transmission lines. The distance to waterways is used to determine feasible and infeasible regions but is not used to determine the final suitability score. It is possible to upload one’s own layer if they have the data for another criterion.
