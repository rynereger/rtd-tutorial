Navajo Nation Site Suitability Tool

This serves as the first step to choosing where to create a utility scale solar project in the Navajon Nation.


**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

Lumache has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs.
