Welcome to the documentation for the Solar Suitability Tool on the Navajo Nation!
===================================

This tool is designed to serve as the first step to choosing where to locate a solar energy project.
It currently uses only publicly available data from ArcGIS Online.

It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

Lumache has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs.
