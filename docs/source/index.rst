Tribal lands hold an estimated 6.5% of the total national utility-scale solar 
technical potential in the contiguous United States. Current siting practices 
typically ignore the social and cultural impacts of solar development, which 
can delay or terminate utility-scale energy projects especially if a project 
infringes on individual livelihood and local land use practices. Through early 
engagement with the tribal government of the Navajo Nation, we combined a 
Geographic Information System with a Multicriteria Decision Analysis (GIS-MCDA) 
to develop a tool to determine the relative suitability of utility-scale solar 
development on Navajo tribal lands. This serves as the documentation of this tool.

**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

Lumache has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs.
